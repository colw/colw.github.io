<p>All programmers are tempted to roll their own writing platform at some point. This website is my turn.</p>

<p>In terms of sophistication, it sits somewhere between WordPress and a pencil. The app will read Markdown files from a folder called 'posts',
and then spit out an index page. Posts are ordered by date. No special syntax, it simply uses <code>util.format()</code> for placement in a template file.</p>

<p>Give me a little while and I'll see the light and switch over to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> or some such. But until then I'll have some fun.</p>

<p>I'm happy with that, and I'll add to it as I see fit.</p>

<p>NASA has built a <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov">great website</a> to see a listing of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">ISS</a> sightings by city. It comes in tabular form with an accessible RSS feed. For
example, here is the listing for <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=Germany&amp;region=None&amp;city=Berlin">Berlin, Germany</a>.</p>

<p>Useful, but what I needed was a calender instantly accessible from my phone.</p>

<p>You can use the two below projects to create such an .ics file and host it somewhere, such as your public <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
folder. Then subscribe to that location using your calendar app.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/colw/spotthestation-rss-reader">Spot the Station RSS Parsing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/colw/spotthestation-ics-creator">Spot the Station Calendar Creation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I personally use Apple's Calendar apps on Mac OS X and iOS to test this. Google Calendar doesn't complain though. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>It's only 'developer friendly' right now, and a work in progress. It wouldn't take much work to create a user friendly front end.</p></div>
