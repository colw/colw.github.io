    <h2>Spot the Station Tools</h2>
      <p>NASA has built a <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov">great website</a>
        to see a listing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">ISS</a> sightings by city.
        It comes in tabular form with an accessible RSS feed.
        For example, here is the listing for
          <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=Germany&region=None&city=Berlin">Berlin, Germany</a>.</p>
      <p>Useful, but what I needed was a calender instantly accessible from my phone.</p>
      <p>You can use the two below projects to create such an .ics file
        and host it somewhere, such as your public <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> folder.
        Then subscribe to that location using your calendar app.</p>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/colw/spotthestation-ics-creator">Spot the Station Calendar Creation</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p> I personally use Apple's Calendar apps on Mac OS X and iOS to test this.
        Google Calendar doesn't complain though. Your mileage may vary.</p>
      <p> It's only 'developer friendly' right now, and a work in progress. It wouldn't take much work to create a user friendly front end.</p>
