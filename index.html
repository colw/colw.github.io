<div class="postdate">Monday, 9 March 2015</div>
<div class="postcontent"><p>I've deployed a test app for downloading <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov">NASA's Spot The Station sightings</a> as an ICS
calendar.</p>

<p>There's no fancy front end yet, just a URL Scheme that follows:</p>

<p><code>/place/Country/Region/City</code> or <code>/place/Country/City</code></p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://spotthestationcal.herokuapp.com/place/Australia/New_South_Wales/Sydney">Sightings for Sydney, Australia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://spotthestationcal.herokuapp.com/place/Germany/Berlin">Sightings for Berlin, Germany</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes a region is needed, other times not. For now, just use the <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov">NASA App</a> to find
the correct name hierarchy for your city.</p>

<p><em>Note: I threw this together quickly. It works, and well enough to share, but it's still at a very early stage.</em></p></div>

<div class="postdate">Friday, 27 February 2015</div>
<div class="postcontent"><p>The Ruminant does the work for you, sending you news from a selection of sources around the world. You don't have to do
anything.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wellreadruminant.com"><img src="/images/Guernsey_cow.png" alt="A black and white cow" title="A well read Ruminant" /></a></p>

<p>It's very easy to search or filter by typing in the box. It's instant actually, and if you want to keep it, just hit
enter and the term will be added to a tag list. You can stack filter tags on top of each other.</p>

<p>As an extra, place a dash (-) at the beginning of the term and you can choose what <em>not</em> to see.</p>

<p>Click any filter tags to remove them and it's like they were never there. Magic.</p>

<p>I personally find myself using it with a few tabs open, each one with a different set of filters. Other times, I just
filter as I go.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress. I'm still experiementing with the feed selection and trying to strike a balance. How much
is too much, or how little is not enough.</p>

<p>Feedback is most welcome!</p>

<div class="postdate">Tuesday, 24 February 2015</div>
<div class="postcontent"><p>A simple news feed aggregator I've been working on. I'm still polishing up the interface but it's quite useable, at least locally.</p>

<p>Set your own RSS feeds in the config file, load it up and wait for something interesting to come in. Once running you can filter the
feed using the input on the right, creating tags as you go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/newscow.png" alt="A screenshot of a new feed aggregator" title="News Feed Aggregator" /></p>

<p>Technically, it's a Node.js backend that will periodically refresh from an array of urls in a json file. These are then
rendered in the client using Facebook's <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> framework.</p>

<p>All communication happens via <a href="http://socket.io">Socket.io</a>, and for a bit of fun the number of other readers is broadcast.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/colw/nxws/">code</a> and try it for yourself.</p></div>

<div class="postdate">Friday, 13 February 2015</div>
<div class="postcontent"><p>All programmers are tempted to roll their own writing platform at some point. This website is my turn.</p>

<p>In terms of sophistication, it sits somewhere between WordPress and a pencil. The app will read Markdown files from a folder called 'posts',
and then spit out an index page. Posts are ordered by date. No special syntax, it simply uses <code>util.format()</code> for placement in a template file.</p>

<p>Give me a little while and I'll see the light and switch over to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> or some such. But until then I'll have some fun.</p>

<p>I'm happy with that, and I'll add to it as I see fit.</p>

<div class="postdate">Thursday, 12 February 2015</div>
<div class="postcontent"><p>NASA has built a <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov">great website</a> to see a listing of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">ISS</a> sightings by city. It comes in tabular form with an accessible RSS feed. For
example, here is the listing for <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=Germany&amp;region=None&amp;city=Berlin">Berlin, Germany</a>.</p>

<p>Useful, but what I needed was a calender instantly accessible from my phone.</p>

<p>You can use the two below projects to create such an .ics file and host it somewhere, such as your public <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
folder. Then subscribe to that location using your calendar app.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/colw/spotthestation-rss-reader">Spot the Station RSS Parsing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/colw/spotthestation-ics-creator">Spot the Station Calendar Creation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I personally use Apple's Calendar apps on Mac OS X and iOS to test this. Google Calendar doesn't complain though. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>It's only 'developer friendly' right now, and a work in progress. It wouldn't take much work to create a user friendly front end.</p></div>
