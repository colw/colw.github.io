<div class="postcontent"><p>The Ruminant does the work for you, sending you news from a selection of sources around the world. You don't have to do anything.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Guernsey_cow.png" alt="A black and white cow" title="A well read Ruminant" /></p>

<p>You can choose what you want to see. Only interested in what's happening in Copenhagen? Enter 'copenhagen' into the side bar and press
Enter. Only want to see news from Reuters? Enter 'reuters.com'. Don't want to see anything from The New York Times? '-nytimes' will do
you right. Add a '-' to the start of any filter for exclusions.</p>

<p>Click any filter tags to remove them. It's like they were never there.</p>

<div class="postcontent"><p>A simple news feed aggregator I've been working on. I'm still polishing up the interface but it's quite useable, at least locally.</p>

<p>Set your own RSS feeds in the config file, load it up and wait for something interesting to come in. Once running you can filter the
feed using the input on the right, creating tags as you go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/newscow.png" alt="A screenshot of a new feed aggregator" title="News Feed Aggregator" /></p>

<p>Technically, it's a Node.js backend that will periodically refresh from an array of urls in a json file. These are then
rendered in the client using Facebook's <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> framework.</p>

<p>All communication happens via <a href="http://socket.io">Socket.io</a>, and for a bit of fun the number of other readers is broadcast.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/colw/nxws/">code</a> and try it for yourself.</p></div>

<span class="postdate">February 13th 2015</span>
<div class="postcontent"><p>All programmers are tempted to roll their own writing platform at some point. This website is my turn.</p>

<p>In terms of sophistication, it sits somewhere between WordPress and a pencil. The app will read Markdown files from a folder called 'posts',
and then spit out an index page. Posts are ordered by date. No special syntax, it simply uses <code>util.format()</code> for placement in a template file.</p>

<p>Give me a little while and I'll see the light and switch over to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> or some such. But until then I'll have some fun.</p>

<p>I'm happy with that, and I'll add to it as I see fit.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/colw/colw.github.io/">See the repository for more details</a>.</p></div>

<a href="posts/2015/2/12/spotthestationtools.html"><h2 class="postheading">Spot the Station Tools</h2></a>
<span class="postdate">February 12th 2015</span>
<div class="postcontent"><p>NASA has built a <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov">great website</a> to see a listing of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">ISS</a> sightings by city. It comes in tabular form with an accessible RSS feed. For
example, here is the listing for <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=Germany&amp;region=None&amp;city=Berlin">Berlin, Germany</a>.</p>

<p>Useful, but what I needed was a calender instantly accessible from my phone.</p>

<p>You can use the two below projects to create such an .ics file and host it somewhere, such as your public <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
folder. Then subscribe to that location using your calendar app.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/colw/spotthestation-rss-reader">Spot the Station RSS Parsing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/colw/spotthestation-ics-creator">Spot the Station Calendar Creation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I personally use Apple's Calendar apps on Mac OS X and iOS to test this. Google Calendar doesn't complain though. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>It's only 'developer friendly' right now, and a work in progress. It wouldn't take much work to create a user friendly front end.</p></div>
