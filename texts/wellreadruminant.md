The Ruminant does the work for you, sending you news from a selection of sources around the world. You don't have to do anything.

You can choose what you want to see. Only interested in what's happening in Copenhagen? Enter 'copenhagen' into the side bar and press
Enter. Only want to see news from Reuters? Enter 'reuters.com'. Don't want to see anything from The New York Times? '-nytimes' will do
you right. Add a '-' to the start of any filter for exclusions.
 
Click any filter tags to remove them. It's like they were never there.
