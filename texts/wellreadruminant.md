The Ruminant does the work for you, sending you news from a selection of sources around the world. You don't have to do
anything.

It's very easy to search or filter by typing in the box. It's instant actually, and if you want to keep it, just hit
enter and the term will be added to a tag list. You can stack filter tags on top of each other.

As an extra, place a dash (-) at the beginning of the term and you can choose what *not* to see.
 
Click any filter tags to remove them and it's like they were never there. Magic.

This is a work in porgress. I'm still experiementing with the feed selection. How many is too many, or how little is
not enough. I personally find myself using it with a few tabs open, and each one has a different set of filters.

Feedback is most welcome!
