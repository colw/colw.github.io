Spot the Station Tools
------------------------

NASA has built a [great website](http://spotthestation.nasa.gov) to see a listing of
[ISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) sightings by city. It comes in tabular form with an accessible RSS feed. For
example, here is the listing for [Berlin, Germany](http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=Germany&region=None&city=Berlin).

Useful, but what I needed was a calender instantly accessible from my phone.

You can use the two below projects to create such an .ics file and host it somewhere, such as your public [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com)
folder. Then subscribe to that location using your calendar app.

  * [Spot the Station Calendar Creation](https://github.com/colw/spotthestation-ics-creator)

I personally use Apple's Calendar apps on Mac OS X and iOS to test this. Google Calendar doesn't complain though. Your mileage may vary.

It's only 'developer friendly' right now, and a work in progress. It wouldn't take much work to create a user friendly front end.
