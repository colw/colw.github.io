â¦¿ Page Making

    Friday, 13 February 2015

All programmers are tempted to roll their own writing platform at some point. This website is my turn.

In terms of sophistication, it sits somewhere between WordPress and a pencil. The app will read Markdown files from a folder called 'posts',
and then spit out an index page. Posts are ordered by date. No special syntax, it simply uses `util.format()` for placement in a template file.

Give me a little while and I'll see the light and switch over to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or some such. But until then I'll have some fun.

I'm happy with that, and I'll add to it as I see fit.
